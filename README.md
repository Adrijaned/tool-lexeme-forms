# Wikidata Lexeme Forms

[This tool](https://tools.wmflabs.org/lexeme-forms/) lets users create Wikidata lexemes with pre-populated forms,
such as the declensions of a noun or the conjugations of a verb.

## Toolforge setup

On Wikimedia Toolforge, this tool runs under the `lexeme-forms` tool name.
Source code resides in `~/www/python/src/`,
a virtual environment is set up in `~/www/python/venv/`,
logs end up in `~/uwsgi.log`.

If the web service is not running for some reason, run the following command:
```
webservice --backend=kubernetes python start
```
If it’s acting up, try the same command with `restart` instead of `start`.

To update the service, run the following commands:
```
source ~/www/python/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
webservice --backend=kubernetes python restart
```

## Local development setup

You can also run the tool locally, which is much more convenient for development
(for example, Flask will automatically reload the application any time you save a file).
Note that a local setup will not actually perform edits unless you create a `config.yaml` file.

```
git clone https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/source/tool-lexeme-forms.git
cd tool-lexeme-forms
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
```

If you want, you can do this inside some virtualenv too.
